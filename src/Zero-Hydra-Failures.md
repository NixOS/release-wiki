# ZERO Hydra Failures

## Hydra resource scale-up

Some days before ZHF starts is a good time to request the scale up of Hydra
resources for the duration of ZHF and release to improve the iteration speed we
can support and reduce the timeframe of alowing large rebuilds.
[21.11 example](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-org-configurations/issues/186).

## ZHF issue

- Create an issue for tracking Zero Hydra Failures progress. ZHF is an effort
  to get build failures down to zero.
  [22.05 example](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/172160)

- With RFC85, the
  [nixpkgs/trunk](https://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/nixpkgs/trunk) jobset will be
  used to track regressions.

- Monitor the issue and linked Pull Requests and check if new blockers come up.

- Get in contact with the staging team (for example via their Matrix room) in
  the last days before branch-off to coordinate the staging-next merges.
