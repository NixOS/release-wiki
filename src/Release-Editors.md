# Release Editors

The role of the Release Editors is a result of an action item from the 21.11
release, where the satistfaction with the release notes was low.

The first Release Editor role was filled in the 22.05 release with a focus on
the release notes and content for the homepage.

With continued dissatisfaction after the 23.05 release, the Release Editor at
the time decided to improve the editing process by two measures:

- Creating a style guide

- Developing a linter

## Responsibiltiies

- Improve the legibility of the release notes

- Correct grammar and spelling issues

- Sorting the highlight section by importance for NixOS
