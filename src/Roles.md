# Roles

The release process currently knows two kinds of roles, whose duties
should be documented in this wiki.

- [Release Managers](Release-Managers.md)
- [Release Editors](Release-Editors.md)

Both roles have been filled by two persons each since the 22.11 release.

One person will have already worked on the previous release, while the
other one will be new to the release process, and can bring in new
ideas, while benefitting from the knowledge transfer.

The process to find new team member should be started at least two and
half months before the next release, so that the schedule documented in
this wiki can be followed. This "Call for Release-Manager and Release
-Editor" should be posted with sufficient spare time to the Discourse.
