# Beta Phase

- Monitor the master branch for bugfixes and minor updates and
  cherry-pick them to the release branch.

- Start marking packages as broken. There is no fully defined process to do
  this, so look at the corresponding
  [issue](https://github.com/NixOS/release-wiki/issues/4) and also
  [this discussion](https://github.com/NixOS/release-wiki/pull/42#discussion_r882695363).
