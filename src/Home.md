This is the official wiki for the NixOS release process.
All release managers should document how they're actively changing the release process here.
And also use as it as a reference on how to release NixOS and engage the community.

This is not a set of rules but rather what the previous release managers did.
It mainly serves as a list of tasks to remember and is not written in stone.
This means that if you are a Release Manager and think you can do thing better, feel free to do so!
Also, if you are not a Release Manager and think the process can be improved, open an Issue or Pull Request on the [repository](https://github.com/NixOS/release-wiki).
