# Retrospective

The retrospective is an important part of the release process where we
give every member of the community the chance to give feedback about
their experience, what went well and what did not.

## After the release

1. Set a date and time one week after the release date. This is still
   early enough, so people will remember things about the release, but
   late enough, so they will have had time to reflect. An hour is
   usually sufficient for this.

   Make sure the time slot works for people from the EU and US, where
   most of the current contributors reside.

1. Plan a venue. We usually rely on Jitsi Meet for conversations that
   include audio/video as well as screensharing.

1. Create the invitation post over on the Discourse. Examples:
   - [NixOS 22.11 Retrospective](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-22-11-retrospective/23858/5)
   - [22.05 Retrospective](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/22-05-retrospective/19413)
   - [21.11 Retrospective](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/21-11-retrospective/16406)

## During the retrospective

1. Provide a collaborative document, that participants can edit. It
   should allow adding and classifying discussion items. In recent
   retrospectives we classified things as good/neutral/bad.

   Examples:
     - [22.11 Retrospective](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ohn1s9RFFMAfd_XMF8sJNl7xs9QpAtYNTjEY9IwXAho/edit#gid=0)

1. Put up limits for how long a single discussion point can take place,
   so every topic can be addressed.

1. Identify action items from the discussion points and identify
   people who would want to follow up on those.

## After the retrospective

1. Post the conclusions onto the Discourse thread. Also link the notes
   that were made during the event.

1. Follow up on assigned action items.
